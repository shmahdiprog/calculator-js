### in this project I code a calculator with HTML and vanilla CSS and vanilla JavaSript 
Hello everyone
wellcome to my calculator! It's a simple calculator using JavaSript.
There is a problem that you can't do more than 2 operations.
if you open project for first time you can understan it, but after you click you can't see this description (beacuse I use 'local storage' ðŸ˜œ)
I hope you enjoy it.
Please share your comments about this projects with me
## For using the calculator you have to downlad all of the files then open index.html
